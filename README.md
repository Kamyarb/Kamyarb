- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kamyarb 
- I am interested in machine learning and deep learning is centered on computer vision and related problems. Furthermore, possess strong math and programming skills. The current focus of my research is studying how the brain works to track multiple objects using eye-tracking devices. In addition to predicting mesh saliency, attention modeling can predict saccadic human scan paths with highly accurate deep models.
